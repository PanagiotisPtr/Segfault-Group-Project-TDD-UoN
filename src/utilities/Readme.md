# Utilities

Midway through the development project we decided that our organisational method for tests were lacking, and our classes were going to become 1000+ lines.

To fix this we had to refactor our code, but this would take a long time so to prevent a time sink we built a few scripts that did the majority of the breaking up work for us.

These 3 python files in this directory are the ones that were used to make the majority of the changes, followed by a human audit and edge case protection.
